    <h1>My Short Bio</h1>
    <p>I am a junior at North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University. Some of my hobbies consist of playing the piano, playing basketball, and watching movies. My favorite food would have to be curry chicken cooked in a Jamaican style. Iâ€™ve always been intrigued by the constant innovations of software development which has influenced me to major in Computer Science. I would like to indulge in the game development department due to always having an underlying passion for creation and gaming. I am very determined to become a successful individual in this field. I possess excellent technical and collaborative skills that can be essential for a multitude of roles. Therefore, I am starting to look for various roles in the software/game development field to further my experience and knowledge.</p>
